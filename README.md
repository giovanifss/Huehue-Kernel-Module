# Huehue-Linux-Module
I was learning how to write linux modules  with [Julia Evans](https://github.com/jvns).

This module is totally inspired in her [rickroll module](https://github.com/jvns/kernel-module-fun).

## Installing
To see it working, run ```make``` and ```insmod huehue.ko```.  
**DO NOT FORGET** to remove it: ```rmmod huehue```.  
- Remember to check the full path to file in huehue.c (huehue_meme).  
- Point to an existent file.
